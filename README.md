PDroid full history
==============================

This is the original history, ported from subversion, of the PDroid framework, created by svyat. This repo contains the PDroid framework from initial commit to version 1.32 and were made against the AOSP [android-2.3.4_r1](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/manifest/+/android-2.3.4_r1) tag.

The PDroid framework was published under the __GNU GPLv3.0__ license. All changes to the Android framework are the sole work of svyat. He appended copyright headers where he felt appropriate.

PDroid
---------------
PDroid is an Android security and privacy framework. It allows users to control the data passed to system and user applications without the FCing often associated with permission control. The user is put in charge of which app can recieve what data, regardless of the application. 

These framework changes are designed to work in tandem with a permission managment app, [PDroid](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1357056).


How to get it?
-------------

Svyat halted work on PDroid after Gingerbread, but the community continued to port it forward. There is a more formal group working on a continuation/expansion called OpenPdroid.

The [OpenPDroid repos](https://github.com/OpenPDroid) contain build patches and trees for Android 2.3 and up. 


If you are interested in PDroid, you can either build a patched rom using the resources here, or attempt to patch an already compiled build with a tool called [The Auto-Patcher](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1719408).
